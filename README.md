# Star Wars RPG Game
UofT Bootcamp - Week 4 Assignment

# Description
Online RPG game with a Star Wars theme

## Technology used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Jquery

## Resolutions
When developing this game I found it difficult to keep the code organized because I had to store various 'characters' all with very specific properties. I found that using a constructor object to form the framework for each player, and then creating new objects with specific player values, made the code much cleaner and easier to work with. 
 
## Instructions
* Choose a character and then try to defeat all the enemies
* Every attack elicits a counter attack from the enemy
* Every successful attack will double your attack points
* If your score gets to zero then you lose the game
